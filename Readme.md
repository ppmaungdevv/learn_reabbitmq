## Work Queues

In this one we'll create a Work Queue that will be used to distribute time-consuming tasks among multiple workers.

Using message acknowledgments, `noAck: false` and `channel.ack(msg)` in `channel.consume` in worker, and prefetch, `channel.prefetch(1)` after `channel.assertQueue` in worker, you can set up a work queue. The durability options, `durable: true` in `channel.assertQueue` in both worker and task, let the tasks survive even if RabbitMQ is restarted.

run the following command in docker console

```
node new_task.js 1 message.............
```

```
node worker.js
```

## Publish/Subscribe

In this part we'll deliver a message to multiple consumers. This pattern is known as "publish/subscribe".
